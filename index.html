                <p> During the COVID-19 lockdown I had some time at hand during which I picked up Baking.<br>
                    Soon it became something I looked forward to, it was definitely the ray of sunshine during the dooming lockdown.<br>
                    I started baking regualry for some reason or the other, for my roomates' birthday, to celebrate a good grade, to mourn a bad exam, to satisfy my sweet tooth etc.<br>

                                    I got creative and combined the two flavours.

                <p> I am sure many people enjoy reading, but my connection to reading is different from other.<br>
                    I was never intrigued by the fantasy land of stories, but someone told my parents that reading english books/newspapers is the best way to learn the english language<br>
                    So my parents started making me read the news paper every morning before school, the scary news articles gave me nightmares so we switched to reaing stories before bedtime<br>
                    I started reading books in fear and to avoid the newspaper, soon I was caught in the imaginative world of Dr. Suess, Roal Dahl and Enid Blyton.<br>
                    I started loving reading, soon the fear of the newspaper vapourized and I started spending my spare time in the beautiful literally world.<br>

                                The author writes the epic from the POV of the female protagnist Draupadi wife of the five Pandavs.<br>
                                The book provides a unique perspective towards the epic and talks in great detail about the role of Draupadi in the epic.<br>
                                The book humanizes the Pandav brothers and highlights the their mistakes.<br> I would recommend the book to Mahabharat enthusiasts.

                            <p>The book authored by Rhonda Byme is a book that talks about law of attraction<br>
                                How all people attract what happens to them, and thus began the manisfestation trend<br>
                                What I like the most about this book is the simplicity of the concept, that whatever we focus our energy on the universe brings that to us impartially.<br>
                                The book teaches one to take responsibility for what heppens to them and learn to focus on the positive things and stop dwelling on the negative things.<br>
